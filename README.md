I'm Ava and I'm currently a PhD candidate in neuroscience studying the mechanisms underlying short-term vocal plasticity in (_Carollia perspicillata_) bats. 

I'm very keen to collaborate with other researchers and developers working on tools for the detection, classification, and analysis of natural sounds, particularly animal vocalizations
and particularly implemented in R or Python. 

I'm also interested in looking at the cross-species vocal behavior.

For any recommendations or if you'd be interested in collaboratiing, drop me a line!
